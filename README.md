# SHOOT OUT!

Single-screen reaction duel. No tutorials. No “READY.” One cue. One shot.

## Run locally

### Option A: Open directly
- Put `index.html`, `style.css`, `game.js` in one folder.
- Double-click `index.html` to open in a browser.

Note: Some mobile browsers behave better when served over HTTP. If anything looks odd on iPhone, use Option B.

### Option B: Local server (recommended)
From the folder containing the files:

```bash
python3 -m http.server 8000
